# Glossary of Terms in Holochains
Holochain
 : "Holochain" does not refer to any single chain, but the collective construct of multiple source chains which post their public data to a shared data space (usually a DHT), which validates the authorship, provenance, and any required application logic or business rules BEFORE propagating the data.

Source Chain
 : (a.k.a Authoring Chain)

Nucleus
 : Application Container implemented for a specific language

 ^^ That is the markdown format for glossary definitions

 But the big list of definitions is currently being [worked on in a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X9MB7JVKZ2_nvaC9jIAQRAdFwyDiJbArLPCz8g4PVQg/edit#gid=725181120) so we can alphabetize the list.
