# List of Dockerfiles
> the `./` context is assumed to be the root of a `git clone https://github.com/metacurrency/holochain.git`

* ./Dockerfile
 * creates an image from the latest master of github.com/metacurrency/holochain
 * its kind of reasonable to assume that this would never be useful to anyone, as it might as well be an image on dokerhub. Its useful to have this here in this list for completeness
* ./Dockerfile.coreDevelopment
 *
