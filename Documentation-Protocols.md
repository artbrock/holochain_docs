- Use [the waffle](https://waffle.io/metacurrency/holochain) to coordinate documentation tasks (assign tasks to one of the documentation milestones)
- If you want feedback on some writing or changes, add an issue, or a comment to an existing ticket.
- New pages should be incorporated into the [sidebar](https://github.com/metacurrency/holochain/wiki/_Sidebar/_edit)
- Add the the word TODO (all caps no spaces) directly in places in the wiki where things need to be added. This allows us to [search](https://github.com/metacurrency/holochain/search?q=TODO&type=Wikis&utf8=%E2%9C%93) for them.
