## Beyond Blockchain Bottlenecks
A fully distributed P2P blockchain alternative
not just "decentralized" but fully distributed because each person has their own chain, and share from their signed chain to shared data space (DHT)

## When to Use Holochain
For group stuff, ...

## When NOT to Use Holochain
Not for individual. Not for data positivist oriented stuff

## Architecture Overview
Three Sub-Systems / Two Modes


More details see [Architecture page](Architecture)

## Why Ceptr? Where does this come from?
Holochain is a part of a much larger vision for distributed computing to enable quantum leaps in our collective intelligence and abilities for groups to organize themselves on all scales. You can find out more about [Ceptr here](http://ceptr.org).

## A Note to End Users
Be patient, grasshopper. Soon there will be applications built to make it easy to use holochains as your distributed database for all your daily needs. Hopefully, these applications will be as easy to find, install, and use as any other software you can think of. However, at the moment, these apps don't exist and holochain is largely for developers trying to build these things for you. Check back in Q2 of 2017 for some cool applications.

For now, please [enjoy our FAQ](FAQ). :)
