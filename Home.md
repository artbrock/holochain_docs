## Shared Data Integrity
Historically, the integrity of data integrity has been integrally connected with access to that data. If we want to make sure nobody can tamper with data, we've locked it behind firewalls, or limited permissions in databases or file systems, because with centrally stored data, having the ability to write data typically means you can change whatever you want.

People are excited about building on blockchain, because blockchains are a strategy to maintain integrity of data that is held by peers with no central authority. Breakthroughs in this domain can enable new patterns of human organization without the power imbalance inherent to only some parties controlling the data.

## Beyond Blockchain Bottlenecks
Holochains take a different approach to ensuring the integrity of shared data. Instead of being organized around cryptographic tokens they are organized around people (peers) and the cryptographic record of their actions.

This change allows us to manage data integrity without the massive overhead of computing consensus on global ledger, achieving eventual consistency in a special kind of distributed hash table (DHT).

The lower overhead of this approach makes it feasible to run full nodes on devices like cell phones or tablets which don't have massive computing power.

Holochain is designed as a data integrity engine for distributed applications to run on. Unlike a distributed database, there are no methods for users to directly interact with the data. All interactions happen only through the application code which can enforce whatever business rules, application logic, or restrictions, because different applications have different demands of strictness.

## Summary of Holochain Architecture
You can think of a holochain as a shared DHT in which each piece of data is rooted in the signed hash chain of one or more parties. It is a validating DHT so data cannot propagate without first being validated by shared validation rules held by every node -- like every cell in your body has a copy of the same DNA.

Each holochain has THREE MAIN SUB-SYSTEMS

### Application
The application is the glue that holds all the parts together into a unified whole. You connect to it with a web browser for a user interface. This application can read and write on your own local signed hash chain, and it can also get data from the Shared DHT, and put data you author out on that shared DHT.

Most importantly, it provides the validation rules which everyone runs to make sure the data being held in the shared DHT can't be tampered with, counterfeited, or lost. As of March 2017, you can write applications in JavaScript or Lisp.

### Local Source Chain
Instead a shared global ledger like blockchains, every person has their own local chain that they sign things to before publishing them to the shared DHT. Interactions involving multiple parties (such as a currency transfer between two people) are signed by EACH party and committed to their own chains, and then shared to DHT by each party.

Many of the applications people dream of running in shared decentralized manner (like a distributed Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Uber, or AirBnB) shouldn't need any kind of consensus from a large group of people. Why should I need consensus for a tweet or a social network update? Why should we need consensus for me to reserve your spare room? What do these things have to do with anybody else's agreement?

Thankfully, if an app like this runs on a holochain, I can just write my tweet to my own chain, then share it. Or we can both sign the reservation to each of our chains. And then the information that we've taken this action can propagate over the shared DHT, where nodes can confirm we did this according to shared rules or expectations.

### Shared Storage on Validating DHT
Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are already used for file sharing (bittorrent) and other widespread applications. In these systems, the data is content addressable by cryptographic hash, so you can confirm you receive unaltered data by hashing it yourself.

In our validating DHT, we confirm the provenance of every piece of data, validating the signature of its author, and that it has been committed to their local chain. Multi-party transactions create a "crossing" of chains which also assure that even if you try to alter your own chain, your transaction is published by others. Our DHT also has an unusual feature which allows meta-data to be put on data in the DHT which can be used to publish information about a person/node (such as their transactions, or top of their hashchain) or data element (such as tags, comments, or ratings).

Just like validation rules on blockchain nodes, if someone hacked their code to behave differently, even if they colluded with others, the rest of the nodes on the DHT would not validate their altered behavior and they will have essentially just forked themselves out of being able to participate on that holochain.

## When to Use Holochain
Holochain is designed to support and embody social coherence -- groups that want to collaborate or coordinate together according to a set of agreements which allows them to share data or other value in reliable ways.

Holochains are ideal for:
 * **Social Networks, Social Media & VRM:** You want to run a social network without a company like Facebook in the middle. You want to share, post, publish, or tweet to shared space, while automatically keeping a copy of these things on your own device.
 * **Supply Chains & Open Value Networks:** You want to have information that crosses the boundaries of companies, organizations, countries, which is collaboratively shared and managed, but not under the central control of any one of those organizations.
 * **Cooperatives and New Commons:** You want to create something which is truly held collectively and not by any particular individual. This is especially good for digital assets.
 * **P2P Platforms:** Peer-to-Peer applications where every person has similar capabilities, access, responsibilities, and value is produced collectively.
 * **Collective Intelligence:** Governance, decision-making frameworks, feedback systems, ratings, currencies, annotations, or work flow systems.
 * **Collaborative Applications:** Chats, Discussion Boards, Scheduling Apps, Wikis, Documentation, etc.


## When NOT to Use Holochain
You probably SHOULD NOT use holochain for:
 * **Just for yourself:** You generally don't need distributed tools to just run something for yourself. The exception would be if you want to run a holochain to synchronize certain data across a bunch of your devices (phone, laptop, desktop, cloud server, etc.)
 * **Anonymous / Secret / Private data:** Not only do we need to do a security audit of our encryption and permissions, but you're publishing to a shared DHT space, so unless you really know what you're doing, you should not assume data is private. Some time in the future, I'm sure some applications will add an anonymization layer (like TOR), but that is not native.
 * **Large files:** Think of holochains more like a database than a file system. Nobody wants to be forced to load and host your big files on their devices just because their in the neighborhood of its hash. Use something like [IFPS](http://ipfs.io) if you want a decentralized file system.
 * **Data positivist-oriented apps:** If you have built all of your application logic around the idea that data exists as an absolute truth, not as an assertion by an agent at a time, then you would need to rethink your whole approach before putting it in a Holochain app. This is why _most cryptocurrencies would need significant refactoring_ to move from blockchain to holochain.

## Why Ceptr? Where does this come from?
Holochain is a part of a much larger vision for distributed computing to enable quantum leaps in our collective intelligence and abilities for groups to organize themselves on all scales. You can find out more about [Ceptr here](http://ceptr.org).

## A Note to End Users
Be patient, grasshopper. Soon there will be applications built to make it easy to use holochains as your distributed database for all your daily needs. Hopefully, these applications will be as easy to find, install, and use as any other software you can think of. However, at the moment, these apps don't exist and holochain is largely for developers trying to build these things for you. Check back in Q2 of 2017 for some cool applications.

For now, please [enjoy our FAQ](FAQ). :)
